This was a fantastic opportunity for me to put the practical skills I have learnt so far in my degree into practice and build upon them, in particular my Microsoft Excel skills. I used Microsoft Excel regularly to analyse financial information before collating it into a report for management. I also learnt a lot about how to work effectively and efficiently within a fast-paced environment. I was complimented on my ability to manage a demanding workload and I learnt how to assimilate large amounts of information quickly in order to prepare reports and analyses for management. A particular highlight was going on a business trip to Sweden which was focused around improving the efficiency of work processes. My role also enhanced my understanding of SAP software which I am now a competent user of

								I worked within the accounts department of Complete Communications where I was involved in balancing bank statements and ensuring each payment was accounted for. In addition I learned how to set up direct debit payments. During my time I was also introduced to numerous accounting softwareâ€™s including Sage, used to identify any current debtors that needed to be flagged and dealt with by the credit control department within the company, as well as Ebillz, used to set up new phone charges for customers as well as setting up new account numbers for new customers. Throughout my time at complete communications I also banked the company wages as well as calculating its monthly VAT rate.
