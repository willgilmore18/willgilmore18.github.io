<p class="personal-statement">I am a motivated and conscientious individual who will give 100% to any task I am asked to do. Through upholding various part-time jobs and sporting commitments alongside my studies, I have developed excellent time-management and organisation skills as well as learning how to deliver assignments to a high standard and in a timely fashion.</p>

			<h2 class="experience">Work Experience</h2>
			<p class="work-experience">I spent my third year of University completing a placement with Siemens Industrial Finance Turbomachinery in the Commercial Project Management Department. This was a fantastic opportunity for me to put the practical skills I have learnt so far in my degree into practice and build upon them, in particular my Microsoft Excel skills. I used Microsoft Excel regularly to analyse financial information before collating it into a report for management. I also learnt a lot about how to work effectively and efficiently within a fast-paced environment. I was complimented on my ability to manage a demanding workload and I learnt how to assimilate large amounts of information quickly in order to prepare reports and analyses for management. A particular highlight was going on a business trip to Sweden which was focused around improving the efficiency of work processes. My role also enhanced my understanding of SAP software which I am now a competent user of. </p>
